# 磁盘索引：hash和tree



#### 1. Static hashing

#### 2. Dynamic hashing

Hash bucket is the on-disk structure. Due to the slow disk access, several methods are proposed to dynamically extend the hash table. For example, extendable hashing by Knuth (1973), and linear hashing by Litwin (1978).

A drawback of dynamic hashing is that it demand one more indirection to find the on-disk address when doing a search. 

* Extendable hashing

The main idea is to split a bucket when it is going to overflow, and the bit number used of the hash key will consequently grow.

* Linear hashing
