# 索引：哈希和树(Hashing and Tree)

## 1. Hashing

首先哈希表可以分为静态哈希和动态哈希：

#### 1.1 Static hashing[4]

Static hashing faces the conflict issue, which can be solved by "linear probing" or "chaining with separate lists".

* linear probing on disk

When using hashing on disk, the IO unit of linear probing is disk blocks. When search for a key, we start at a block and proceeds linearly until the key is found or a block is not full.

* chaining with separate lists

When using chained list hashing on disk, one disk block can store multiple keys. Thus when keys are small and blocks are big, the oveflows will be very rare and we can expect search for a key using one I/O.

#### 2. Dynamic hashing

Hash bucket is the on-disk structure. Due to the slow disk access, several methods are proposed to dynamically extend the hash table. For example, "extendable hashing" by Knuth (1973), and "linear hashing" by Litwin (1978).

A drawback of dynamic hashing is that it demand one more indirection to find the on-disk address when searching a item. 

* Extendable hashing[1][2]

The main idea is to split a bucket when it is going to overflow, and the bit number used of the hash key will consequently grow.

* Linear hashing[3][4]

"gradually increasing and decreasing the range of hash functions with the size of the set."
